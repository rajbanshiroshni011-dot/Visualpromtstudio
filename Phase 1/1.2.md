# Visual prompt studio 1.2 - copilot Prompt
## Copilot prompt: Create a realistic high-resolution photograph of a framed wall display case divided by horizontal shelves and a vertical center panel. The display case contains black-and-white family photographs in rectangular frames, metallic trophies with curved handles, plaques, certificates, and glass awards. The arrangement should feel organized and structured, almost symmetrical, but with slight variation in object placement. Use soft indoor lighting that creates reflections on the glass and metal surfaces. The background inside the case should be dark to create strong contrast between highlights and shadows. The overall mood should feel reflective, documentary, and personal, emphasizing memory and achievement.
## Reflection: Handwritten reflection image is included in the folder.
